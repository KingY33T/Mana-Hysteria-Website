   <p style="color: lightgreen;">This page is what would have been the HOH (hall of homies). I've all but scrapped this idea because it would've been an extensive list of everyone I considered a friend, which at the time would have been people i *just* liked. Of course, since the incident, im more strict about who i consider a friend and therefore a page dedicated to such a gargantuine list of people wont be nessecary and would quite frankly be exausting to constantly update with me meeting and leaving people constantly. That being said, Ill probably only have a short box with friend sites somewhere on this site.
