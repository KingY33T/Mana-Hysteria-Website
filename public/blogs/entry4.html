      <p>Hello everyone, happy new year, but most importantly... Welcome back!!! ^u^</p>
      <p>Im not exactly sure what to put in blog posts regarding site re-opening, maybe a sorta psuedo patch notes, but the site is so small as of right now that I feel all the changes are obvious. The biggest one (probably) being that it has a domain name now!</p>
      <p>I suppose I could talk about how things are going? ┐(´ー｀)┌</p>
      <p>Well for starters, Im gonna focus on the art page! I wanna finish archiving my artwork on there. It's gonna look a little empty when it's done, mainly in the more recent years, because I just was to busy or wasn't in the mood to make anything. I love making art, but it's a ritual that I gotta know when my body is ready for.</p>
      <p>Once thats done I wanna move on to making some more assets for the site, mainly for the art page, such as the "fanart" icon and a border to use for all the drawing thumbnails. Im back out of the artistic swing after making emojis for the guestbook and my first comic strip.</p>
      <p>Speaking of my comic strip, I gotta host that over here when I start making more of them. Gonna change the front page to make room for the latest one, get rid of the cbox, put some other stuff on my front page, but now im just getting ahead of myself.</p>
      <p>I have too much planned for this site and too little time to do it before next semester. But you know what, im glad I was able to make so much progress on the site this school season. Like I don't think ive done more to this site in the past couple of months than I have for the past couple years beforehand. Ive made a page for blogs, actually started the art page (in a rough state), added the guestbook, improved the art page, made my first comic strip, and even started using a github deployer.</p>
      <p>Im so proud of how things are going so far. Thank you so much everyone!!!</p>
