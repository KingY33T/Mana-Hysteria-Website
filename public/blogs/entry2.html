  Welcome to my blog!!!

    <p>Heya noobs! Thank you for checking out my blog! Its a bit rough right now, mainly the menu to select each entry, but at least it exists now.</p>
  <p>I don't know how often I plan on posting here, but worst comes worst ill just move the blog files off the site and host em elsewere. At least in this format I can speak my mind more indepth without having it be broken up. Offers a lot of freedom with how I can express myself through posts at the cost of the quantity of em.</p><p style="text-align: center;transform: rotate3d(2, 1, 1, 298deg);margin: 50px;font-size: 24px;">Can social media do THIS?!?!?!</p><p>Here i might just talk about my life (not to personal), tips, my opinions and interests, maybe news about the site. Whatever tf id post on my bluesky, but just... more thought provoking ig. I decided to make each blog page rather freeform, with a bunch of assets on my site that i can reuse over and over for each blog and edit the style in html to suit the mood of the post. This all might end up in an unoptimized clusterfuck that takes up too much site filespace in the end, but again, worst comes worst, I just make some css files and problem solved. These pages shouldn't be too complicated anyways, at least most of em shouldn't be. I also don't know if I should have my latest blog embeded in the front page or not, or if i should let ppl search for it. I really have a problem with trying to condense a bunch of crap into the front page and i gotta make better decisions on what should be prioritized.</p><p>Thats all for now! Cya! ^-^</p></div></body></html>
