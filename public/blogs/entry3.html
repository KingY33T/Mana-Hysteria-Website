    <p>Hoi everyon!!! This is the first post ill be making directly on this site regarding it's development. As you can see ive pulled out the cool looking background i made for this site a while back, which im still planning to use, but i need to tweak the brightness of the layers as to not make it an eyestrain while still making some darker elements visible and not just blending in. I may need to clean up this site quite soon when it comes to aesthetics.</p>

">Aesthetic</p><p>Theres a few things I really need to touch on. Doing something about the yellow orange sticky note appearance the site currently has, probably making the cursor easier to see, the background like I just mentioned, making cards for each drawing on the art page, organizing my art, finalizing the art category menu, and eventually finalizing the front page and remaking the old Mana Hysteria logo, bc the top of that page has been empty for faaaar too long. Those last two might take a while. A lot of the aesthetic work will take a while anyways bc I have two seperate ssd's where I store my site files in and I gotta sort through those.</p><p style="

">Mana Hysteria but thinner</p><p>Another thing I wanted to work on was a more condensed version of the front page. I wasn't proud of how my first attempt at doing that turned out, partly bc my hubby didn't like it either. Part of the problem is that I designed this site with 1024x768 monitors in mind, but for some reason I decided to try and crank it down to 800x600 because I thought it would look more clean and organized or smth. This site contains big elements and I try to cram as much stuff that I think is important at the top of the page. This worked in the original resolution because I could always expand outawrds, but I really gotta think about what i should prioritize when I make a smaller version. Plus It would mean redoing some assets. Im just going to make a debug page and work on that condensed version from there.</p><p style="

">Communication and archiving</p><p>Now for the guestbook. Im going to prioritize the guestbook as the main form of chat on this site. I know the masses(peeps on discord) have yearned for both guestbook and the CBOX, but they essentially do the same thing and a guestbook is more typical and probably just better overall. All websites on neocities ask you to sign their guestbook n crap, so it all just makes the CBOX look a little useless. Imma probably archive everything on the CBOX and, speaking of archiving, download a copy of this entire website before I get to the aesthetic overhaul I mentioned later. My last hope for this site when im really happy with it is to join a webring or two. Thats WAAAAAAAAY into the future of this site, but just a cherry on top of everything ive been working on so far.</p><p>Thank you for reading this and I hope you have a wonderful evening!!!
